# Frequently Asked Questions

### “When it comes to industrial case study, can it be an industrial case study on what my startup has done for a large multinational client on creating a computer vision solution and the value it provided, with the case study coauthored with the client?” 

**Yes, this is exactly the type of contributions we have in mind.**

### "IMHO, 4-8 pages is quite a lot of "material" for industry to write."

**The limits (4 and 8 pages) refer to the MAXIMUM amount of pages for the two types of submissions we seek, but we are focusing on CONTENT NOT on LENGTH. Shorter contributions are encouraged.**
