Serial AI entrepreneur Dr. Paul (as he is affectionately known in the industry) has been at the bleeding intersection of real-time AI and computer graphics since 2000 when he founded AI.implant to enable the= creation of huge crowds of interacting autonomous entities. Customers included Disney and Lucas Film for visual effects; Bioware and EA for game development; and L3 and Lockheed Martin for military simulation. 

AI.implant was acquired in 2005 by Engenuity/Presagis/CAE, the world’s leading developer of software tools for military simulation and training. In 2007, he founded GRIP to enable video game developers to create rich game AI characters without programming: “Microsoft Word of game AI”. Customers included Bioware, Disney, EA and Eidos. GRIP was acquired in 2011 by Autodesk, the world’s leading developer of software tools for digital entertainment. 

In 2014, he founded wrnch to create human centric AI by teaching cameras to understand human behavior in order to enable thousands of applications to make the world safer, healthier and more fun. wrnch’s customers include the largest media and entertainment companies in the world.
